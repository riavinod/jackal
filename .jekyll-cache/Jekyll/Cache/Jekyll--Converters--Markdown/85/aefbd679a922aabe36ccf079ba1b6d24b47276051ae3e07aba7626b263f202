  Hi! This page is currently under construction, so please bear with me as I populate it with details about my research/projects and writings!

  I am a first-year PhD student at Brown University's Center for Computational and Molecular Biology. My early research focuses on representation learning methods for molecular property prediction. I graduated from UC Berkeley in the Spring of 2021 where I studied Electrical Engineering and Computer Science.
