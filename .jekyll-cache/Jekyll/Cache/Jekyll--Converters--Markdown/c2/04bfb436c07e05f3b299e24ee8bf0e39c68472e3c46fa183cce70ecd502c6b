  <p>Hi! This page is currently under construction, so please bear with me as I populate it with details about my research/projects and writings!</p>

  <p>I am a first-year PhD student at Brown Universityâ€™s Center for Computational and Molecular Biology. My early research focuses on representation learning methods for molecular property prediction. I graduated from UC Berkeley in the Spring of 2021 where I studied Electrical Engineering and Computer Science.</p>
